Classes
=======

This is a complete list of available classes:

- [`Shrink0r\Monatic\Eventually`](Shrink0r/Monatic/Eventually.md) &mdash; Wraps a given callable, which will eventually invoke a given success callback, when it can provide a value.
- [`Shrink0r\Monatic\Many`](Shrink0r/Monatic/Many.md) &mdash; Wraps a given collection, thereby providing recursive/fluent access to any underlying collections.
- [`Shrink0r\Monatic\ManyMaybe`](Shrink0r/Monatic/ManyMaybe.md) &mdash; Special subtype of the Many monad, that composes it&#039;s collection-items into Maybe monads.
- [`Shrink0r\Monatic\Maybe`](Shrink0r/Monatic/Maybe.md) &mdash; Wraps a given value and provides fluent access to it&#039;s underlying properties.
- [`Shrink0r\Monatic\None`](Shrink0r/Monatic/None.md) &mdash; Acts as a null-value for the Maybe monad.
